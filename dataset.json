        "description": "Charles-Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns (9 October 1835 \u2013 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\"Organ\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886).\n\nPlease support my channel:\nhttps://ko-fi.com/bartjebartmans\n\nPiano Concerto No. 5 in F major (\"Egyptian\"), Op. 103 (1895-96)\nDedication:  Louis Di\u00e9mer (1843-1919)\n\n1. Allegro animato (0:00)\n2. Andante (9:44)\n3. Molto Allegro (\"Sea Voyage\") (20:18)\n\nJean-Yves Thibaudet, piano and the Royal Concergebouw Orchestra conducted by Andris Nelsons\nLive Recording AvroTros Klassiek 16 november 2011, Concertgebouw Amsterdam\n\nDescription by John Palmer  [-]\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns composed his Fifth Piano Concerto while in Egypt in the winter of 1895-1896. It was published in 1896 with a dedication to pianist Louis Di\u00e9mer (1843-1919), who played the piece on several occasions. It is one of the composer's \"exotic\" works, in which he uses the minor mode with raised sixth and seventh degrees (often called the \"melodic\" minor). This is the earliest concerto by a French composer to incorporate such \"exoticisms,\" effects that had hitherto been reserved for shorter works and suites. Saint-Sa\u00ebns' Africa, Op. 89 (1891), and Suite alg\u00e9rienne, Op. 60 (1880), also employ modal inflections to produce local color.\n\nIn this grandiose work, Saint-Sa\u00ebns' references to his time in Egypt include the imitation of croaking of frogs he heard in the Nile, a \"Nubian love song,\" and the turning of a ship's propellers in the Finale. The composer wrote that the second part of the concerto, \"in effect, takes us on a journey to the East and even, in the F sharp passage, to the Far East.\" These effects, plus the place of the concerto's origin, prompted the nickname, \"Egyptian,\" which was not given by the composer. It is the most blatantly pictorial of Saint-Sa\u00ebns' concertos.\n\nAt the first performance of the Fifth Concerto, critics hailed it as \"a work of fantasy ornamented and colored like one of the prettiest buildings of the Alhambra....\" Both the composition of the Fifth Concerto and its positive reception were rejuvenating experiences for the composer, who had by this time been in the public eye for 60 years. To the orchestration of the earlier Fourth Concerto Saint-Sa\u00ebns adds two horns, piccolo, and a gong, which slips in surreptitiously as the piano plays a modal, \"oriental\" passage.",

        "description": "- Composer: Sergei Vasilievich Rachmaninoff (1 April 1873 -- 28 March 1943) \n- Orchestra: National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland\n- Choir: Dublin Radio Telefis Eireann Symphony Chorus\n- Conductor: Alexander Anissimov\n- Soloists: Ivan Choupenitch (tenor), Oleg Melnikov (bass), Helen Field (soprano)\n- Year of recording: 1996-1997\n\n\"The Bells\" [\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430, Kolokola], choral symphony for soprano, tenor, baritone, chorus & orchestra, Op. 35, written in 1913.\n\n00:00 - I. Allegro ma non tanto ('The Silver Sleigh Bells')\n06:47 - II. Lento ('The Mellow Wedding Bells')\n17:40 - III. Presto ('The Loud Alarum Bells')\n26:16 - IV. Lento lugubre ('The Mournful Iron Bells')\n\nWhile it is true that Rachmaninov's choral symphony The Bells was ultimately based on the Edgar Allan Poe poem of the same name, its more direct inspiration was the Konstantin Balmont translation into Russian, which takes substantial liberties with the text. He eliminated Poe's repetitions, which are so central to his onomatopoetic devices, and he generally ignored his meter. Ironically, The Bells is often performed in English, using a translation of Balmont's translation!\n\nThe score for The Bells requires a tenor, soprano, baritone, chorus and large orchestra. The three soloists never sing together, nor do they even appear in the same movement. The four sections of the work represent four aspects of life: birth, marriage, terror, and death.\n\n- The first movement, marked Allegro ma non troppo, is subtitled The Silver Sleigh Bells and features a prominent tenor part. The mood is effervescent and joyous, the scoring colorful and the themes and harmonies richly post-Romantic, typical of the works of the composer's middle years. After a nearly two-minute introduction dominated by an irresistible three-note \"giddy-up\" theme, the tenor enters to intone the words \"Listen, hear the silver bells.\" With the chorus serving mostly in an accompanimental role, the merriment continues for a short while, then gradually subsides, leading to a slow but brief middle section. The tempo picks back up and the music quickly rises to an ecstatic climax, with the brass and bells (celesta) playing a march-like motif while chorus and orchestra gradually fade.\n- The Lento second movement is subtitled The Mellow Wedding Bells, and features a soprano soloist. Rachmaninov focuses on the more passionate and intimate aspects associated with weddings. There is one glorious, climactic outburst in the middle of the movement, but the music is otherwise relatively subdued in its unabashedly Romantic demeanor. Without doubt, this is the warmest and most beautiful of the four movements. For all its sanguine beauty, though, there is an allusion near the beginning here to the Dies Irae theme, that ubiquitous motif that crops up in the finale here and in almost every major orchestral composition of Rachmaninov.\n- The Presto third movement has been described as demonic. Subtitled The Loud Alarum Bells and representing terror, the music sounds threatening almost from the outset. It begins softly and slowly, but swiftly gathers momentum and mass. The chorus enters with singing that verges on shouting, and thereafter the mood remains unsettled and tense, dark and dissonant. The climax features an outburst on percussion and grim singing by the chorus. As the music seems to fade for a quiet ending, suddenly the tempo picks up and the chorus rises in a powerful crescendo and the movement ends abruptly.\n- The finale, marked Lento lugubre and subtitled The Mournful Iron Bells, certainly lives up to these descriptions. It is gloomy; the sound of the baritone is dark, and that of the chorus cold and dispiriting. At the end Rachmaninov conveys only grudging hope, when the music turns sad and warmly Romantic, as the baritone tells of the \"quiet of the tomb\".\n\nPremiered on 8 February 1914 in Moscow, this was the composer's favorite work, and the dedication is to \"Willem Mengelberg and his Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam\".",

        "description": "Charles-Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns (9 October 1835 \u2013 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\"Organ\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886).\n\nPlease support my channel:\nhttps://ko-fi.com/bartjebartmans\n\nPIano Concerto No. 1 in D Major, Op.17 (1858)\nDedication \u00e0 Madame Alfred Ja\u00ebll (Marie Ja\u00ebll)\n\n1. Andante  - Allegro assai (0:00)\n2. Andante sostenuto, quasi adagio (12:28)\n3. Allegro con fuoco (22:57)\n\nPascal Rog\u00e9, piano and the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Charles Dutoit\n\nDescription by John Palmer  [-]\nAmong Saint-Sa\u00ebns's pieces written after Viennese Classical-era models are his piano concertos, the first few of which are some of the earliest works in the genre composed in France. Although it was written in 1858, his Piano Concerto No. 1 in D major, Op. 17, was not published until 1875. Through the 1860s Saint-Sa\u00ebns performed the First Piano Concerto on numerous occasions and later, in 1920, wrote that the piece was inspired by the forest of Fontainebleau. Ten years separate this first concerto from the second, which may explain the adolescent abandon with which Saint-Sa\u00ebns approaches the concerto, prompting his virtuoso technique to take center stage. With an unusual lack of sensitivity, Saint-Sa\u00ebns supporter Emile Baumann described the first concerto as \"youthful hyperbole; runs, arpeggios of exuberant proportions, an ambitious sortie into grandiose prolixity.\" Unfortunately, this tells us nothing of the composer's attempt to modify the Classical form of the concerto.\n\nThe Introduction to the first movement begins with a hunting call for horn that is taken up and completed by the piano. (Some have likened this theme to that of the Allegro vivace theme of Chopin's F minor Concerto.) Shortly thereafter we hear an idea that becomes the \"motto\" in this cyclically conceived concerto. This motto also marks off the sections of the first movement, acting as transitional material in a manner that shows Saint-Sa\u00ebns working symphonic thinking into the concerto format. At times, especially in the middle of the movement, the piano is subservient to orchestra, the overall argument becoming an egalitarian conversation that is hinted at in the introduction when the piano finishes the horn theme.\n\nAntagonism is at the heart of the second movement, in which the first theme, a descending phrase in the orchestra, is broken off several times by chords in the piano. Eventually, the piano wins and moves to a flashy cadenza, unusual for a slow movement. Ornamental trills at the close of the second movement are much more than decorative and serve a harmonic function, a concept pursued by Ravel in his Jeux d'eau of 1901.\n\nIn the lighthearted, sonata-form finale the horn calls and the motto theme of the introduction returns in the final measures. The secondary theme of the finale is, at first, very lyrical, but is transformed by the end to create a loud, crashing close. The alternation of chords between the piano and orchestra is the full realization of the implied equality between the forces found in the first movement. This process is also clear in the various presentations of the second theme, which in the first instance is performed in the piano with brief interruptions from the orchestra, but in the recapitulation the roles are reversed, with the orchestra stating the theme against piano outbursts.",
